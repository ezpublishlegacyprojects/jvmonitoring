jvMonitoring
2009 Jerome Vieilledent


REQUIREMENTS
============

Currently, the only requirements are :

 * eZ Publish 4.x
 * cURL extension (compiled with PHP in most cases)
 * Access to shell_exec() function


INSTALLATION
============

1. Unpack the package under extension/ directory
2. Activate jvmonitoring through the backoffice or directly in settings/override/site.ini.append.php :
   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveExtensions[]=jvmonitoring
   
   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the
   sites should use the extension, make the changes in the override file of
   that siteaccess.
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=jvmonitoring

3. Regenerate the classes autoload array for extensions :
   $ php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -e
   
4. Clear the cache :
   $ php bin/php/ezcache.php --clear-tag=ini
   $ php bin/php/ezcache.php --clear-all
   

To check if the extension works, go to http://<your-host-name>/jvmonitoring/monitor (of course add index.php in URL when needed)
