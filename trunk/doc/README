Introduction
============

1. What is the JV Monitoring extension ?
   -------------------------------------
   JV Monitoring allows you to "monitor" your application. It checks health of your website by using handlers.
   
2. Which handlers are provided by default ?
   ----------------------------------------
   JVMonitoring comes with several monitor handlers to check : 
    * Database (connection, insert, select and delete queries). 
      Warning ! If no connection can be made to your DB server, 
      an uncatchable exception can be thrown avoiding the test page to appear.
    * HTTP Access (from the server, using proxy if configured).
    * PHP CLI access
    * Image handling (presence of GD extension and access to ImageMagick binary if activated in image.ini)

    Handlers can be configured in jvmonitoring.ini (please make an override of it). Read the comments in this file.
    
3. What will the monitor page display ?
   ------------------------------------
   Monitor page (jvmonitoring/monitor) will display results of each test. 
   OK will be displayed if test passed
   KO will be displayed if test failed with an error message if available
   A general status is also provided. 
   Keyword displayed can be configured in jvmonitoring.ini : GlobalStatusOK or GlobalStatusKO

4. What will happen if at least one of the tests fails ?
   -----------------------------------------------------
   GlobalStatusKO keyword configured in jvmonitoring.ini will be displayed at the bottom of the page
   Additionnaly, a HTTP 500 error will be sent.

   Warning ! If no connection to DB can be made, eZ Publish will throw an uncatchable exception
   So no keyword will be displayed, but the HTTP 500 error will be sent though
   

Additional handlers
===================

It is possible to develop additional handlers to allow you to monitor specific parts of your application if needed.
To do that, you'll need to create a PHP class implementing IJVMonitoringHandler interface.
Then you must declare your handler in jvmonitoring.ini. See comments in jvmonitoring.ini for more details
